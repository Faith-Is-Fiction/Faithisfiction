      <h2>My discovery: how light focuse from a small hole
      </h2>
      <div class="date">January 9th, 2025</div>
      <p>I made a small hole with my hands (like holding water) and looked at a letter through it. To my surprise, the letter looked smaller! As I made the hole bigger, the letter returned to its normal size. Itâ€™s all about how light focuses through a tiny opening. Next time you're bored, give it a tryâ€”you'll be amazed! ðŸ‘€âœ¨"

      <h2>Finding radius of Earth

      <p>How to Measure the Earth's Radius with Minimal Resources
        
        
        Want to measure the Earth's radius with just a few tools? Hereâ€™s a simple, resource-light method using geometry and sunlight:
        
        Method: Using Shadows and Geometry
        
        What you need:
        1. Two places a known distance apart (800 km or more, preferably on the same meridian).
        2. A protractor or stick to measure the angle of the Sunâ€™s rays at noon.
        3. The distance between the two places.
        
        Steps:
        
        1. Choose Two Locations: Pick two places on the same meridian, separated by at least 800 km.
        
        2. Measure the Sun's Angle: At noon, use a vertical stick to measure the angle of the Sunâ€™s rays at both locations. The Sun will be more overhead at the equator and lower as you move north or south.
        
        3. Find the Difference in Angles: Subtract the two angles to get the angular distance between the two locations on Earth.
        
        4. Apply Geometry: The angle difference represents the fraction of Earth's circumference between the two points. Use the formula:
        
           (d / C) = (angle difference / 360)

   Where `d` is the distance between the locations, and `C` is the Earth's circumference.

5. Calculate Earth's Radius: Once you have the circumference `C`, use the formula for the circumference of a circle:

   C = 2 * pi * r

   Solve for `r` (the Earth's radius):

   r = C / (2 * pi)

This simple method, relying on basic geometry, gives you a great approximation of the Earthâ€™s radius with minimal resources!

      <h2>Automated Railway Crossing Safety Model Using Laser Sensing
      </h2>
      <div class="date">late 2023</div>
      <p>In 2023, during my time in Grade 7, I participated in a science exhibition where I presented an innovative solution designed to enhance safety at railway-road junctions. My project aimed to automate the traditional manual operation performed by personnel stationed at these crossings.

The model utilized a laser sensor system to detect approaching trains. When a train interrupted the laser beam, the system would automatically block the railway crossing and activate a warning buzzer, alerting pedestrians and vehicles to stop. This smart mechanism significantly reduces human effort and enhances safety by providing timely alerts and automatic gate control.
